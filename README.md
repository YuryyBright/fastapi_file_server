Welcome to the **FastAPI Application Template**! This repository offers the **best solution for a file server API with user interface capabilities**. Built with FastAPI, it provides robust **authentication**, **authorization**, and **easy-to-use database management**. The template is designed with flexibility and performance in mind, perfect for developers needing a fast and secure way to build APIs with integrated user management.

### Key Features:
- **FastAPI Backend**: A high-performance API built with FastAPI.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Built-in JWT-based security for user login, registration, and refresh tokens.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM, providing an easy and asynchronous way to interact with the database.
- **Admin Command-Line Tool**: Easy management of users, settings, and server operations via the `Typer` CLI.
- **User Interface**: **Jinja templates** integrated with **Bootstrap** and **jQuery** for a clean, responsive front-end.
- **Docker Support**: Seamless Docker integration to develop and deploy your app in containers.
- **Testing Suite**: Built-in tests using `pytest` with automatic GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

This template also includes **file management** features, making it the ideal choice for projects that require file handling APIs with an intuitive user interface.
